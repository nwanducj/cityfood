        To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy,
        or claim related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively,
        the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and
        collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to
        negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below)
        informally for at least __________ days before initiating arbitration.
        Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party
        to the other Party. <br /><br />Binding Arbitration<br />
        Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract,
        including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
        termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
        International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
        Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to
        the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is
        considered as the part of this clause. The number of arbitrators shall
        be two. The seat, or legal place, or arbitration shall be Enugu. The
        language of the proceedings shall be English Language. The governing law
        of the contract shall be substantive law of Lagos, Nigeria.
        <br /><br />Restrictions<br />
        The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute
        between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law,
        (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a
        class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there
        is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
        representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other
        persons. <br /><br />Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and
        Arbitration<br />
        The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
        above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration:
        (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
        validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any
        Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
        invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
        injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
        unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute
        falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
        unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
        jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
        Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
