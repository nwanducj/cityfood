        <br />

        section called "HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?" below.

        <br />
        All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete
        and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal
        information.
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <br />
        We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or
        navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific
        identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device
        and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device
        characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs,
        device name, country, location, information about how and when you use

        primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services,
        and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

        <br />
        <br />

        <br /> Location Data. We collect location data such as information
        about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise.
        How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the
        device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and
        other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your
        current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing
        us to collect this information either by refusing access to the
        information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note
        however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain
        aspects of the Services. Information collected through our App In Short:

        permissions, you may do so in your device's settings. <br /> Push
        Notifications. We may request to send you push notifications regarding
        your account or certain features of the App. If you wish to opt-out from

        <br />
         Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific
        consent to use your personal information for a specific purpose.

        <br />
         Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are
        legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable law,
        governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal
        process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena (including

        potential threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or
        as evidence in litigation in which we are involved. More specifically,
        we may need to process your data or share your personal information in
        the following situations:
        <br />
        Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in
        connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company
        assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to
        another company.

        <br /> Google Maps Platform APIs. We may share your information with
        certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Place API). To
        find out more about Google’s Privacy Policy, please refer to this link.
        We obtain and store on your device ('cache') your location. You may
        revoke your consent anytime by contacting us at the contact details
        provided at the end of this document. <br />
        Business Partners. We may share your information with our business
        partners to offer you certain products, services or promotions.

        <br /> Offer Wall. Our App may display a third-party hosted "offer
        wall." Such an offer wall allows third-party advertisers to offer
        virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for the
        acceptance and completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall
        may appear in our App and be displayed to you based on certain data,
        such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click
        on an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging
        to other persons and will leave our App. A unique identifier, such as
        your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to
        prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.
        Please note that we do not control third-party websites and have no

        4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?<br />
        In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect
        and store your information. We may use cookies and similar tracking
        technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
        information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and
        how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.

        <br />
        <br />

        5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS? <br />In Short: If you choose to
        register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may
        have access to certain information about you. Our Services offers you
        the ability to register and login using your third-party social media
        account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose
        to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from
        your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary
        depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include
        your name, email address, friends list, profile picture as well as other
        information you choose to make public on such social media platform. We
        will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your
        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
        their sites and apps.

        <br />
        <br />
        6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
        <br />
        In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil
        the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required
        by law. We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
        of time in which users have an account with us. When we have no ongoing
        legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will
        either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible
        (for example, because your personal information has been stored in
        backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information
        and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

        <br /><br />
        7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
        <br />In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
        system of organizational and technical security measures. We have
        implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures
        designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.
        However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
        no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage
        technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or
        guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
        parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect,
        access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best
        to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
        only access the Services within a secure environment.

        <br /><br />8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?<br />
        In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children
        under 18 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit data from or market
        to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent
        that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such
        a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we
        learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
        been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
        measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become
        aware
        <br />
        of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please
        contact us at <a>info.cityfood@gmail.com</a>.

        <br /><br />

        <br />In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any
        time. If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are
        unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right
        to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can

        <br />
        Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web browsers are set to accept
        cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your
        browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove
        cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or
        services of our Services. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by
        advertisers on our Services visit
        <a>http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>. Opting out of email marketing:
        You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by
        clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by
        contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed
        from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with
        you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary
        for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service
        requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you
        may: <br /> Access your account settings and update your preferences.

        <br /><br />
        10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES <br />Most web browsers and some
        mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
        ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy
        preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
        monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard
        for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
        such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
        online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow
        in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
        version of this privacy notice.
